\subsection{Summary of Tools and Projects}

The standards and services of a VO are meant to be used in the end 
by applications. The Applications working group have defined only two major
standards for application interoperability beyond the services standards: 
(1) the Simple Application Messaging Protocol (SAMP), and (2) the VOTable
format. These standards, plus all the other protocols and standards 
allows VO-compliant tools to be developed, which are the endpoints for
science production. In the next table we summarize the most used tools
and they status.

	\hline
  Cross-Comparision Tool & USA & a web tool that performs croos-comparisons between one table supplied by the user and other of an online source 
								catalog, for a user-specified match radius. This returns the all sources in the online catalog that are within the radius.\\
	\hline								 
  Data Discovery Tool & USA &  A web tool that allows to find datasets from astronomical collections known to the VO like the Hubble Space Telescope 
									(HST), the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Spitzer Space Telescope, among other.\\

  Time Series Search Tool & USA & A web tool that allows to access the time series data sets at the Harvard Time Series Center (TSC), the NASA 
									Exoplanet Archive and the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey, and analize them with the periodogram application 
									of the NASA Exoplanet Archive.\\
