\subsection{Summary of VO-enabled Tools }

The standards and services of a VO are meant to be used in the end 
by applications. The Applications working group have defined only two major
standards for application interoperability beyond the services standards: 
(1) the Simple Application Messaging Protocol (SAMP), and (2) the VOTable
format. These standards, plus all the other protocols and standards 
allows VO-compliant tools to be developed, which are the endpoints for
science production. In Table~\ref{table:app} we summarize the most used tools
and they status.
