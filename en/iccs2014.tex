\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a short survey on the astronomical Virtual Observatories
(VOs) that are
part of the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA). From how they are
distributed worldwide to their specialization range on the electromagnetic
spectrum,
we summarize key aspects of the current 19 VO members.
