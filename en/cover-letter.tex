\section{Response to the Reviewer}

\quoting{
Reviewer \#1: The paper present a simple survey of the Virtual Observatory
framework. 
}

We agree. We have changed the title of
the paper to ``A Simple Survey on the Virtual Observatory'' in order to provide
a more accurate description of the paper.

\quoting{
So, while 2.4 cap illustrates very simply the main VO standards, section 3 looks
more focusing on the geographical distribution of the IVOA partners and does not
put evidence enough to the tools developed over the standards.
}

We have added section 2.5, that summarizes the VO toolkits for publishing data
and their current status.

\quoting{
One of the main
success of the IVOA is not only to develop international standards to make data
interoperable but also sponsored tools that allowing the easy access to these
data.
}

We have added an updated list of the most used VO tools, to emphasize the 
importance of them as the visible side of IVOA. 

\quoting{
Also the big work done about the semantics is not nominated (UCD): it's an
essential part of the VOTable standard needed to move astronomical data to the
web 2.0.
}

We have added a new paragraph in section 2.4 that highlight the work done in
semantics. We have specifically 

\quoting{
About cap 4. It is not well clear what does it means. 
}

TODO

\quoting{
Also table 3 : is it a list ( example ) of Vo resources ??  are you sure that
all services are active ?
}

TODO

\quoting{
Since this is a simple survey, add a list like tab 1 with standards and tools
can be usefull.
}
