Evaluating a NoSQL alternative for Chilean Virtual Observatory Services

Currently, the standards and protocols for data access in the Virtual 
Observatory architecture (DAL) are generally implemented with relational 
databases based on SQL. In particular, the Astronomical Data Query Language
(ADQL), language used by IVOA to represent queries to VO services, was 
created to satisfy the different data access protocols, such as Simple Cone 
Search. ADQL is based in SQL92, and has extra functionality implemented using 
PgSphere.

An emergent alternative to SQL are the so called NoSQL databases, which
can be classified in several categories such as Column, Document, Key-Value, Graph, Object, etc.;
each one recommended for different scenarios. Within their notable
characteristics we can find: schema-free, easy replication support, simple API,
Big Data, etc.

The Chilean Virtual Observatory (ChiVO) is developing a functional prototype
based on the IVOA architecture, with the following relevant factors: 
Performance, Scalability, Flexibility, Complexity, and
Functionality. Currently, it's very difficult to compare these factors, due
to a lack of alternatives.
 
The objective of this paper is to compare NoSQL alternatives with SQL through 
the implementation of a Web API REST that satisfies ChiVO's needs: a 
SESAME-style name resolver for the data from ALMA. Therefore, we propose a test 
scenario by configuring a NoSQL database with data from different sources and 
evaluating the feasibility of creating a Simple Cone Search service and its
performance. This comparison will allow to pave the way for the
application of Big Data databases in the Virtual Observatory.
